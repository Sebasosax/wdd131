            <h2>Mosiah 16:9</h2>
            <p>He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a
            life which is endless, that there can be no more death.</p>

            <h2>Helaman 5:1</h2>
            <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye
            must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind,
            yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to
            the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation
            whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>
